# Senior .NET Developer Technical Assessment

## Task: Implement the FizzBuzz Game

### Problem Statement:
Create a program that solves the classic FizzBuzz problem:

- Print the numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of five, print "Buzz".
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".

### Requirements:
- **Good Practices**: The task is not only about making the solution work but also about demonstrating your knowledge and application of good coding practices, such as clean code, SOLID principles, and design patterns.
- **Design Patterns**: Wherever applicable, use appropriate design patterns to enhance the code structure.
- **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests to verify the correctness of your solution.
- **Code Quality**: Ensure that your solution is maintainable, readable, and scalable. Use meaningful names, proper abstractions, and follow conventions where necessary.

### Additional Information:
- The code should be written in C#.
- Use any testing framework (e.g., NUnit, xUnit, MSTest) for unit testing.
- You may use any version of .NET Core or .NET 6 and above.
